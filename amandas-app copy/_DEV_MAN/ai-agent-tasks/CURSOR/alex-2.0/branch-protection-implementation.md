# Branch Protection Implementation
Version: Alex v1.3.3
Date: 2024-02-27 11:54 CST

## Overview
Implementing GitHub branch protection rules to secure our production environment.

## Starting Point
- Working Commit: 6d4e71d (Last successful deployment)
- Failed Commit: 8bf9b0d (PR #8 - Failed to deploy)
- Branch: feat/github-protection
- Status: Clean state (stashed previous changes)

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Last Working Deploy: 6d4e71d (11 hours ago)
- ‚ùå Latest Failed Deploy: PR #8 (8bf9b0d, 48 minutes ago)
- Action: Implementing protection to prevent future failed deployments

## Protection Rules to Implement
1. Branch name pattern: production
2. Required settings:
   - ‚úì Require pull request before merging
   - ‚úì Require approvals (minimum: 1)
   - ‚úì Require status checks to pass
   - ‚úì Require branches up to date
   - ‚úì Include administrators

## Implementation Steps
1. ‚úÖ Created branch from working commit
2. üîÑ Rollback Plan:
   - Current State: On feat/github-protection (from 6d4e71d)
   - Need to revert PR #8 on GitHub (8bf9b0d)
   - Roll production back to 6d4e71d
3. ‚è≥ Add GitHub branch protection rules
4. ‚è≥ Verify protection rules
5. ‚è≥ Document results

## Next Steps
After branch protection is in place and verified:
1. Wait for Vercel stability confirmation
2. Implement issue bot for automated PR suggestions

## Critical Rules Being Followed
1. ‚õîÔ∏è NO modifications to local files
2. ‚õîÔ∏è NO touching of working code
3. ‚úÖ ONLY GitHub branch protection
4. ‚úÖ Documentation in _DEV_MAN

## Verification Plan
1. Try direct push to production (should fail)
2. Try PR without review (should block)
3. Try PR without status checks (should block)
4. Document all test results
