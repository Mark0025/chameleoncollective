# Client Manifest Fix - HeroSection Component
Version: Alex v1.3.0

Status: ✅ Completed

## Issue
Error during Vercel deployment:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/nextjs-dashboard/.next/server/app/(public)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'
```

## Root Cause
- HeroSection.tsx using Clerk authentication components without 'use client' directive
- Client-side features (auth components) in server component context
- Missing client reference manifest during build

## Solution
Added 'use client' directive to HeroSection.tsx:
```typescript
'use client'
import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
// ... rest of component
```

## Why This Fixed It
1. Clerk Components Requirements:
   - SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton are client-side components
   - They require browser APIs and React hooks
   - Must be marked with 'use client' for proper bundling

2. Component Dependencies:
   - BookButton.tsx (already marked with 'use client')
   - Authentication UI components
   - Interactive elements

3. Build Process:
   - Next.js now correctly identifies client boundary
   - Generates proper client reference manifest
   - Enables correct file tracing during build

## Verification
- ✅ Component properly marked as client
- ✅ Auth components working as expected
- ✅ Clean separation of client/server code
- ✅ No config changes needed

## Notes
- Keep monitoring other components for proper client/server separation
- Ensure all components using Clerk or other client-side libraries are marked with 'use client'
- Follow Next.js 15 best practices for component boundaries
