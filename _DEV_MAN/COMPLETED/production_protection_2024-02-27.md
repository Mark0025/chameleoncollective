# Production Protection Implementation
Timestamp: 2024-02-27 11:19 CST

## Issue Analysis
The production branch in Vercel broke after a merge due to:
1. Route restructuring changes (moving to auth/public groups)
2. Pending production fixes that weren't completed
3. Lack of pre-merge verification for critical files and build status

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Verification Script
Created `scripts/verify-build.sh` that checks:
- Route structure integrity
- Production build success
- Critical functionality via tests

### 2. GitHub Workflow
Added `.github/workflows/production-protection.yml` that:
- Runs on PRs to main/production
- Verifies build and routes
- Ensures all checks pass before merge

### 3. Required Branch Protection Rules

To protect the production branch, the following rules should be enabled in GitHub:
1. Go to repository Settings > Branches
2. Add branch protection rule for 'production' branch:
   - ✓ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✓ Require approvals (at least 1)
   - ✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✓ Require branches to be up to date
   - ✓ Include administrators
   - ✓ Required status checks:
     - "Verify Build and Routes"
     - "Verify Required Checks"

### 4. Deployment Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Run verify-build.sh locally
4. Create PR to production
5. Wait for all checks to pass
6. Get approval
7. Merge

## Preventing Future Issues

1. **Route Changes**
   - Must maintain required files in auth/public groups
   - Changes to route structure require full testing
   - Build verification catches missing files

2. **Build Verification**
   - Automated checks before merge
   - Local verification script
   - Production build testing

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Jest tests must pass
   - Playwright E2E tests must pass
   - Route structure verified

## Recovery Steps for Current Break

1. Verify route structure:
```bash
cd nextjs-dashboard
./scripts/verify-build.sh
```

2. Fix any missing files identified by the script

3. Complete pending production fixes:
   - Review _DEV_MAN/ai-agent-tasks/pending/production_fixes_2024-02-24_1939.md
   - Address all critical issues
   - Run verification script again

4. Create recovery PR:
   - Branch: fix/production-recovery
   - Include all fixes
   - Must pass new protection checks

## Monitoring

1. **Build Status**
   - Watch GitHub Actions for build status
   - Monitor Vercel deployments
   - Check route integrity

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Error rates
