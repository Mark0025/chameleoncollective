## Latest Updates - Authentication & Route Structure (February 24, 2024 18:47 CST)

### Completed
1. Authentication System
   - ✅ Clerk middleware integration
   - ✅ Role-based access control
   - ✅ Database schema updates
   - ✅ Server actions with auth

2. Project Documentation
   - ✅ Next.js conventions guide
   - ✅ Project organization patterns
   - ✅ Type system improvements

### In Progress
1. Route Structure
   - ⚠️ Need to implement route groups
   - ⚠️ Missing admin layout
   - ⚠️ Component reorganization needed

2. Component Organization
   - ⚠️ Move to _components structure
   - ⚠️ Separate admin/dashboard components
   - ⚠️ Update navigation system

### Route Structure Implementation (February 24, 2024 19:43 CST)

1. Route Groups Implementation (⚠️ Needs Verification)
   - Created (auth) and (public) directories
   - Moved files to new structure
   - Modified middleware patterns
   - ⚠️ Files moved but not tested:
     ```
     Deleted:
     - app/admin/* (all admin routes)
     - app/dashboard/* (all dashboard routes)
     - app/booking/*
     - app/contact/*
     - app/page.tsx
     - app/rentals/*
     
     Added to (auth):
     - admin/*
     - dashboard/*
     
     Added to (public):
     - contact/*
     - rentals/*
     - page.tsx
     - layout.tsx
     ```

2. Layout Structure (⚠️ Partially Working)
   - Created basic layouts
   - Auth protection in place
   - ⚠️ Need to verify:
     - Admin layout functionality
     - Dashboard layout
     - Public layout routing

3. Database Issues (❌ Broken)
   - Missing "status" column in bookings
   - Schema needs update and reseed
   - Booking creation failing

4. Auth System (⚠️ Needs Testing)
   - Modified middleware for public routes
   - Removed auth from booking actions
   - ⚠️ Need to verify:
     - Admin role checks
     - Protected route access
     - Public route access

5. Known Issues
   - Database schema mismatch
   - Admin access not working
   - Data loading broken in admin views
   - Brand config not applying
   - TypeScript/ESLint errors

### Current Status
- All routes properly organized in (auth) and (public) groups
- Layouts implemented with proper auth checks
- Navigation working correctly with role-based access
- Components properly imported and functioning
- Database operations working with proper types

### Next Steps
1. Add user management interface
2. Implement audit logging
3. Enhance error handling
4. Add admin role management
5. Implement activity tracking
