we use DEV-MAN to monitor and work with ai at a high level. 

alex.md is a cline cline is alex.msd it is how we version our agents. make sure you understand this. 

all every ai agent should be using this framework. 

DEV_MAN 

Reademe.md - Outlines how DEV_MAN_Framework works. 

Dev_man

example project. 

add new mmenu bar 

DEV_MAN/pending/{task_name_date(get todays date and time with timestamp --started,pending,completed)}

after each interaction we have a working file 

whats_wokring.md - when it is completed so it sould look like this 


DEV_MAN/completed/{task_name_date(get todays date and time with timestamp --started,pending,completed)} - when the task is completed it should be moved here. and the whats_working.md should be updated to reflect the new changes. verbateum and appended to the end of the file 

we will have a master whats_working.md file that every ai reads from and appends to.  

-- 

Dev-MAN - should also have best practices and project structure if ai has nnot created it yet that is allways the first task. 


then we as ai teams want to help eatch other , so all ai agens before every interaction must read the _DEV_MAN- FOLDER AND ALL things  

when a ai has finished it should git commit and checkout feature branch and close the gap like a human is supposed to when writing code. 

you are responsible forkeeping everything organized.
