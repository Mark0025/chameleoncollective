## Completed Tasks

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- Implemented Clerk middleware with proper route protection
- Added role-based access control for admin routes
- Set up public route definitions
- Protected dashboard and admin routes

### 2. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Added users table with auth fields
CREATE TABLE users (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  clerk_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
  first_name VARCHAR(255),
  last_name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Updated bookings table with auth fields
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  customer_email VARCHAR(255),
  customer_phone VARCHAR(255),
  user_id VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(clerk_id)
);
```

### 3. Server Actions Enhancement
- Updated booking creation with user tracking
- Added role-based status handling
- Enhanced event queries with proper permissions
- Added proper error handling for auth failures

### 4. Project Structure Documentation
- Created cursor-rules for Next.js conventions
- Documented project organization best practices
- Added route group and component organization guidelines

### 5. Type System Updates
- Enhanced Event type with proper fields
- Added EventResponse type for better error handling
- Updated booking types with auth fields

## Current Working State

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Clerk Auth
    participant A as App
    participant D as Database

    U->>C: Login with Clerk
    C->>A: Provide user.id
    A->>D: Query user role
    D->>A: Return permissions
    A->>U: Show appropriate UI
```
