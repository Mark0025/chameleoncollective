# Client Manifest Fix - Vercel Deployment
Version: Alex v1.3.0
Date: 2024-02-26 21:07 CST
Status: ✅ Completed

## Issue
Error during Vercel deployment:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/nextjs-dashboard/.next/server/app/(public)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'
```

## Root Cause
- Mixed client/server code in (public)/page.tsx
- Client-side effects (window, useEffect) in server component
- Dynamic imports not properly isolated

## Solution
1. Created dedicated client component:
   ```typescript
   // components/landing/Confetti.tsx
   'use client'
   // Client-side logic isolated here
   ```

2. Cleaned server component:
   ```typescript
   // app/(public)/page.tsx
   // Pure server component, no client-side code
   ```

## Changes Made
1. Created new file: components/landing/Confetti.tsx
   - Isolated all client-side logic
   - Proper 'use client' directive
   - Contained window-related code
   - Dynamic import handling

2. Updated app/(public)/page.tsx
   - Removed 'use client' directive
   - Removed all client-side effects
   - Clean server component implementation
   - Proper component composition

## Benefits
1. Clean separation of client/server concerns
2. Better code organization
3. Proper Next.js 15 patterns
4. No config changes needed
5. Improved build reliability

## Verification
- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ Client component properly isolated
- ✅ Server component clean
- ✅ No mixed client/server code

## Notes
- Keep client components isolated in components/
- Server components should not contain client-side logic
- Use proper 'use client' boundaries
- Follow Next.js 15 component patterns
