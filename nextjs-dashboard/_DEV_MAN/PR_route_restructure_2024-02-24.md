# Route Restructuring Pull Request

## Overview
This PR implements route groups and reorganizes the project structure to better separate public and authenticated routes.

## Key Changes

### Route Groups Implementation
- Created (auth) group for protected routes
- Created (public) group for public routes
- Added proper layouts for each group
- Updated middleware for new structure

### Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive database schema documentation
- Created production fixes task with verification steps
- Updated whats_working.md with accurate status

### File Structure Changes
```
app/
├── (auth)/             # Protected routes
│   ├── admin/         # Admin section
│   └── dashboard/     # User dashboard
├── (public)/          # Public routes
│   ├── contact/
│   ├── rentals/
│   └── page.tsx
```

## Technical Implementation
1. Route Protection:
   - Updated middleware patterns
   - Removed auth from public routes
   - Maintained admin role checks

2. Layout Structure:
   - Added auth layout with protection
   - Added public layout with navigation
   - Preserved existing functionality

3. Documentation:
   - Added database schema documentation
   - Created production fixes task
   - Updated project status

## Testing Done
⚠️ Routes need verification after restructuring:
- [ ] Public routes accessibility
- [ ] Auth protection
- [ ] Admin access
- [ ] Data loading
- [ ] Database operations

## Documentation
- See: _DEV_MAN/database_schema.md
- See: _DEV_MAN/whats_working.md
- See: _DEV_MAN/ai-agent-tasks/pending/production_fixes_2024-02-24_1939.md

## Breaking Changes
- File structure has changed
- Routes moved to new locations
- Database schema needs verification

## Dependencies Added
- None

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Verify all routes are accessible
- [ ] Test auth protection
- [ ] Confirm admin access
- [ ] Check database operations
- [ ] Review documentation accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Run database verification
2. Test all routes in new locations
3. Fix any data loading issues
4. Address TypeScript/ESLint errors
