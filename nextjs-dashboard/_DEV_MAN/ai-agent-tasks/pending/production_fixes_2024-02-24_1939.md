# Production Fixes Task
Status: Pending
Timestamp: 2024-02-24 19:39 CST

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues (Blocking Production)

1. Database Schema Issues
   - "status" column missing in bookings table
   - Database needs reseeding with correct schema
   - Verified in: database_schema.md

2. Auth/Role Issues
   - Admin access not working after login
   - Role checks not functioning properly
   - Needs proper Clerk integration verification

3. Data Loading Issues
   - Products not fetching in admin view
   - Events not populating
   - Path issues after route restructuring

### Current State (Needs Verification)
1. Route Changes Made (Not Verified)
   - Moved files to (auth) and (public) groups
   - Modified middleware for public access
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify all routes still work
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to confirm no functionality lost

2. Partially Working
   - Public routes structure in place
   - Basic form structure exists
   - Route groups created

3. Known Broken
   - Database schema (status column missing)
   - Admin access and roles
   - Data loading in admin views
   - Brand config not applying

### Immediate Verification Needed
1. File Structure
   - Verify all moved files are accessible
   - Test each route in new location
   - Confirm no critical files were lost

2. Database
   - Verify schema before seeding
   - Test booking table structure
   - Confirm data relationships

3. Authentication
   - Test public access
   - Verify admin routes protection
   - Check role-based access

## Implementation Plan (2-Hour Timeline)

### Hour 1: Core Functionality

1. Database Fix (30 mins)
```sql
-- Verify schema
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings';

-- Reseed if needed
curl http://localhost:3000/seed
```

2. Auth/Role Fix (30 mins)
- Update middleware/auth.ts
- Verify Clerk role mapping
- Test admin access flow

### Hour 2: Data & UI

1. Data Loading (30 mins)
- Update fetch paths for products
- Fix event loading in admin view
- Test all CRUD operations

2. Essential UI (20 mins)
- Fix brand config loading
- Basic date picker improvements

3. Deploy (10 mins)
- Final testing
- Production push

## Testing Steps

1. Database Verification
```bash
# Check schema
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/schema

# Test booking creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"eventId":"evt_balloon","date":"2024-03-01"}'
```

2. Auth Flow Testing
- Sign in ‚Üí Should redirect to dashboard
- Admin sign in ‚Üí Should access /admin
- Public booking ‚Üí Should work without auth

3. Data Loading
- Admin products page ‚Üí Should list all products
- Events page ‚Üí Should show calendar
- Booking form ‚Üí Should list available events

## Type Safety Issues (Post-Production)

1. ESLint Warnings
```typescript
// Fix in order:
1. Unused imports (40+ instances)
2. Unescaped entities
3. Missing dependencies
4. Any types
```

2. TypeScript Errors
- Form action types
- Event type mismatches
- Auth type definitions

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/production-fixes
```

2. Commit changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical production issues

- Fixed database schema
- Updated auth flow
- Fixed data loading
- Updated UI components

Breaking Changes: None
Related: #issue_number"
```

3. Push changes:
```bash
git push origin feat/production-fixes
```

## Documentation Updates

1. Update whats_working.md with:
- Fixed issues
- Current state
- Known limitations

2. Update PR_DESCRIPTION.md with:
- Changes made
- Testing done
- Migration steps

## Next Steps

1. Post-Production Tasks
- Clean up TypeScript errors
- Fix ESLint warnings
- Improve UI/UX
- Add missing features

2. Future Improvements
- Enhanced error handling
- Better type safety
- UI polish
- Additional features

## Notes for Next Agent

1. Always read _DEV_MAN first
2. Follow git workflow in readme.md
3. Update whats_working.md with all changes
4. Create proper PR descriptions
5. Test thoroughly before pushing

Remember: The priority is getting a working production build. Type safety and linting issues can be addressed in follow-up PRs.

## Comprehensive Testing Plan (Added 2024-02-25 09:27 CST)

To ensure the application is production-ready, we need to thoroughly test the API endpoints, server actions, database schema, and type safety. Here's a step-by-step testing plan that can be executed even without full context from the DEV_MAN documentation.

### 1. API Endpoint Testing
Use curl to send POST requests to the key endpoints:

- Booking creation: `/api/bookings`
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "eventId": "evt_test",
    "date": "2025-03-01T10:00:00.000Z",
    "name": "John Doe", 
    "email": "john@test.com",
    "phone": "123-456-7890"
  }' http://localhost:3000/api/bookings
  ```
  - Verify 200 status code and booking ID in response
  - Check booking record in database

- Event management: `/api/events`
  ```bash
  # Create
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name": "Test Event",
    "price": 10000,
    "description": "A test event",
    "category": "test"
  }' http://localhost:3000/api/events

  # Read 
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/events

  # Update
  curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name": "Updated Test Event"
  }' http://localhost:3000/api/events/evt_test
  
  # Delete
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/events/evt_test
  ```
  - Verify proper 200 responses and data changes

- Product CRUD: `/api/products`
  - Similar to events, test create, read, update, delete
  - Verify 200 status and data integrity at each step

### 2. Server Action Testing
For each server action:
- Find the action definition in the component (e.g. `app/lib/actions/bookings.ts`)
- Verify it's imported and used correctly in the API route
- Test success case
  - Prepare valid input data
  - Invoke action and check response
  - Confirm database updates
- Test error cases
  - Invalid or missing fields
  - Duplicate records
  - Verify proper error responses

### 3. Database Schema Verification  
- Compare current schema with `_DEV_MAN/database_schema.md`
  - Table names and columns
  - Column data types
  - Relationships (foreign keys)
- Test queries on each table
  - Insert, select, update, delete
  - Join related tables
- Verify constraints and default values are working

### 4. Type Safety Checks
- Review TypeScript interfaces and types
  - API route handlers (`app/api/`)
  - Server actions (`app/lib/actions/`)  
  - Database queries (`app/lib/db.ts`)
- Ensure type definitions match actual data structures
  - Request/response payloads
  - Database schema
- Try passing invalid data and verify type errors are caught

## Documentation Updates
- Update `_DEV_MAN/whats_working.md` with:
  - [x] API testing results
  - [x] Server action testing results  
  - [x] Database schema verification
  - [x] Type safety checks
- Note any issues found and how they were resolved

## Next Steps
1. Review frontend UI and functionality 
2. Verify fixes for all critical issues
3. Merge to main branch and deploy to production
4. Monitor for any errors or performance issues
5. Celebrate! üéâ
