# Production Fixes Task
Status: Pending
Timestamp: 2024-02-24 19:39 CST

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues (Blocking Production)

1. Database Schema Issues
   - "status" column missing in bookings table
   - Database needs reseeding with correct schema
   - Verified in: database_schema.md

2. Auth/Role Issues
   - Admin access not working after login
   - Role checks not functioning properly
   - Needs proper Clerk integration verification

3. Data Loading Issues
   - Products not fetching in admin view
   - Events not populating
   - Path issues after route restructuring

### Current State (Needs Verification)
1. Route Changes Made (Not Verified)
   - Moved files to (auth) and (public) groups
   - Modified middleware for public access
   - ⚠️ Need to verify all routes still work
   - ⚠️ Need to confirm no functionality lost

2. Partially Working
   - Public routes structure in place
   - Basic form structure exists
   - Route groups created

3. Known Broken
   - Database schema (status column missing)
   - Admin access and roles
   - Data loading in admin views
   - Brand config not applying

### Immediate Verification Needed
1. File Structure
   - Verify all moved files are accessible
   - Test each route in new location
   - Confirm no critical files were lost

2. Database
   - Verify schema before seeding
   - Test booking table structure
   - Confirm data relationships

3. Authentication
   - Test public access
   - Verify admin routes protection
   - Check role-based access

## Implementation Plan (2-Hour Timeline)

### Hour 1: Core Functionality

1. Database Fix (30 mins)
```sql
-- Verify schema
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings';

-- Reseed if needed
curl http://localhost:3000/seed
```

2. Auth/Role Fix (30 mins)
- Update middleware/auth.ts
- Verify Clerk role mapping
- Test admin access flow

### Hour 2: Data & UI

1. Data Loading (30 mins)
- Update fetch paths for products
- Fix event loading in admin view
- Test all CRUD operations

2. Essential UI (20 mins)
- Fix brand config loading
- Basic date picker improvements

3. Deploy (10 mins)
- Final testing
- Production push

## Testing Steps

1. Database Verification
```bash
# Check schema
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/schema

# Test booking creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"eventId":"evt_balloon","date":"2024-03-01"}'
```

2. Auth Flow Testing
- Sign in → Should redirect to dashboard
- Admin sign in → Should access /admin
- Public booking → Should work without auth

3. Data Loading
- Admin products page → Should list all products
- Events page → Should show calendar
- Booking form → Should list available events

## Type Safety Issues (Post-Production)

1. ESLint Warnings
```typescript
// Fix in order:
1. Unused imports (40+ instances)
2. Unescaped entities
3. Missing dependencies
4. Any types
```

2. TypeScript Errors
- Form action types
- Event type mismatches
- Auth type definitions

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/production-fixes
```

2. Commit changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical production issues

- Fixed database schema
- Updated auth flow
- Fixed data loading
- Updated UI components

Breaking Changes: None
Related: #issue_number"
```

3. Push changes:
```bash
git push origin feat/production-fixes
```

## Documentation Updates

1. Update whats_working.md with:
- Fixed issues
- Current state
- Known limitations

2. Update PR_DESCRIPTION.md with:
- Changes made
- Testing done
- Migration steps

## Next Steps

1. Post-Production Tasks
- Clean up TypeScript errors
- Fix ESLint warnings
- Improve UI/UX
- Add missing features

2. Future Improvements
- Enhanced error handling
- Better type safety
- UI polish
- Additional features

## Notes for Next Agent

1. Always read _DEV_MAN first
2. Follow git workflow in readme.md
3. Update whats_working.md with all changes
4. Create proper PR descriptions
5. Test thoroughly before pushing

Remember: The priority is getting a working production build. Type safety and linting issues can be addressed in follow-up PRs.



final message to new agent 

we have great docs read them do not make guessing make sure you are using most up2 date versions ask if you need to do not make breaking changes we are modving to production


Now that we've committed all our changes, let me summarize what we've done and what needs to be done next.


Task Completed

Updated whats_working.md to reflect actual status
Route Restructuring

Moved routes to (auth) and (public) groups
Created proper layouts for each group
Updated middleware for new structure
Documented all file movements
Git Management

Next Agent Should:

Verify Database

Check schema matches database_schema.md
