    C --> D[Added Page Extensions]
    
    style A fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#90EE90
    style C fill:#90EE90
    style D fill:#90EE90
```

- Confidence: 100%

## Current Deployment Status

### Latest Build (a75ahuk8s - 86e24c7)
- Implements Clerk initialization fix
- Changes:
  - Updated root layout with conditional rendering
  - Added publishableKey handling
- Expected outcome: Should resolve static build issues
- Confidence: 85%

### Previous Build (j7y4i1nfo - 8551f2c)
- Updates contact page and next.config.ts
- Changes:
  - Added force-dynamic to contact page
  - Updated next.config.ts configuration
- Expected outcome: May still face Clerk initialization issues
- Confidence: 60%

## Environment Variables
```typescript
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_bmV4dC1ha2l0YS0yNC5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_JVEcrK54N3TkSKTkSOJfayqOFePb2Zy0cZUTjap9S9
```
- ✅ Verified correct keys
- ✅ Added to Vercel environment settings

## Tasks for Alex v1.1

### Immediate Monitoring
1. Watch deployment logs for:
   - Static page generation success
   - Clerk initialization errors
   - Client manifest generation

### Potential Issues to Address
1. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add loading states
   - Handle authentication edge cases

2. Testing:
   - Add tests for authentication flows
   - Verify static/dynamic page behavior
   - Test error boundary functionality

3. Optimization:
   - Review static/dynamic page split
   - Optimize build configuration
   - Monitor build times

## Build Confidence Matrix
| Component | Confidence | Status |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Configuration | 90% | ✅ Complete |
| Static/Dynamic | 85% | ⚠️ Needs Verification |
| Auth Flow | 80% | ⚠️ In Progress |
| Documentation | 100% | ✅ Complete |

## Final Notes
The main focus has been on resolving the client manifest error while maintaining proper authentication flow. The solution involves a combination of proper static/dynamic page handling and conditional Clerk initialization. Alex v1.1 should monitor the deployment results and be prepared to implement additional error handling if needed.

Remember to:
1. Check deployment logs for both builds
2. Verify Clerk authentication works in production
3. Monitor static page generation
4. Test dynamic routes functionality
5. Document any new issues that arise
