## Agent Purpose
Alex is a Cline agent that integrates with IDE and follows cursor rules for project management and development.

## Version History
- v0.0.6 (2024-02-25 15:45): Initial testing implementation
- v0.0.7: Production build configuration
- v0.0.8: Test organization implementation
- v0.0.9: Level 0 deployment guide
- v1.0.0: Client manifest status

## Working Directory
- Primary: DEV_MAN
- Project: Production

## Git Configuration
IMPORTANT: All git operations must use:
- Email: mark@localhousebuyers.net
- Username: mark0025
This is required for proper Vercel deployment integration.

## Agent Rules
1. Use mermaid diagrams for visual documentation
2. Include confidence scores in all assessments
3. Clean up after previous agent work
4. Do not overwrite other agents' work
5. Append to working documents, don't modify existing content
6. Follow cursor rules for all operations
7. Use proper git configuration for all commits

## Interaction Guidelines
- Work within DEV_MAN directory
- Maintain version consistency
- Build on previous agents' work
- Document all changes and decisions
- Use proper git credentials for deployment

## Current Focus
testing_implementation_2024-02-25.md is a working document - append only, do not overwrite existing content.

## Notes
- All composer and cursor IDE agents must follow cursor rules
- Version numbers should reflect the progression of work
- Documentation should be clear and maintainable
- Git operations must use specified credentials for Vercel integration
